This task is about mastering gdb.

Here are the steps to reproduce.

On host machine:
make qemu-gdb
./riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb
continue ; ctrl + C 
break sys_sbrk
*call you ./grow binary*
continue (to our sbrk call)
step (till uvmalloc in growproc)
print *p
x/5xg 0x87f43000 (this is the addr put in SATP)
use >> 10 << 12 to calculated nexted address.
The answer is "one new page was allocated", which address is (0x21fd1017 >> 10 << 12)
